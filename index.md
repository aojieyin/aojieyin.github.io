## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/sagor.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> Hello, everyone! I'm Aojie Yin from Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China. I'm currently a first-year master's student in Digital Humanities. In my free time, I enjoy listening to indie music and collecting vinyl records. :)  

  Digital Humanities aims to solve research problems in humanities and social sciences with novel computational methods, and for studying digitalization as a phenomenon. It is based on a mixed methods approach that combines research questions, for example, from book and intellectual history and methodologies derived from data science.

This is the cover of one of my favorite albums, _모호함 속의 너 (Nebulous You)_. It's a beautiful blend of shoegaze and dream pop by Korean indie artist [Della Zyr](https://dellazyr.bandcamp.com/).
